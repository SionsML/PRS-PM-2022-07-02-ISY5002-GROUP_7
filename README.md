## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
This project intends to build a complete working prototype for a driver alertness detection system with the aim of improving the safety of drivers on the road. As covered in the ISSM module, this is an end-to-end Intelligent Pattern Recognition and Sense Making System implementation. 

The main focus will be develop a system that helps to improve the safety of drivers on the road, especially private hire car drivers who drive for long hours of the day at a stretch. The system, relying on computer vision capabilities and built using deep learning techniques, should be able to detect signs of drowsiness and/or distraction in drivers in real-time and alert them automatically in such cases. The idea behind developing such a system is to improve the safety of drivers who spend a major part of their day driving, with the intention being that such a system could eventually be incorporated as a feature in the driversâ€™ apps of ride-hailing services such as Grab, Gojek, etc., among others.
